1)specie versicolor and virginica seem to have similar values for petal length, while specie setosa belongs in a different category.
2)virginica have max sepal lenghth i.e 7.9 and setosa have min sepal length i.e 4.3
3)setosa species have the max sepal width i.e 4.4 and versicolor have the min sepal width i.e 2.0
4)virginica species have the max petal length i.e 6.9 and setosa have the min petal length i.e 1.0
5)virginica have max petal width i.e 2.5 and setosa have min petal width i.e 0.1
6)most common feature among verginica species are as follows:
   a) sepal_length   5.0
   b) sepal_width    3.0
   c) petal_length   1.4
   d) petal1_width   0.2
7)average sepal_length of all species is 5.843333333333335
8)average sepal_width of all species is 3.057333333333334
9)average petal_width of all species is 1.199333333333334
10)average petal_length of all species is 3.7580000000000027
11)total count of data available for all species i.esetosa ,virginica and versicolor is same i.e 50
12)relation between sepal_length and petal_length --->versicolor and virginica are much closely related 
and  species of iris having greater sepal length tends to have greater petal length as well.
