# About Data Set

-The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper.
-It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.
-The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris 
   -1) Iris Setosa
   -2) Iris virginica
   -3) Iris versicolor
-Four features were measured from each sample: 
   -the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
